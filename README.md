# Cache memory simulator
 In this work the idea is to develop a cache memory simulator program. Let's create a cache with just one level, which receives memory accesses and fills its lines and counts the number of HITS and MISS. The developed program will check whether a certain block of RAM memory is already filled in the cache memory lines (HITS) or not (MISS), as well as determine in which line a certain block of RAM memory will be stored. Our simulator is very simple, so we will only consider the positioning of lines in cache memory. The data itself will be ignored, and therefore will not be simulated.
